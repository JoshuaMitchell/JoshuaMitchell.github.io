            <h2> Why Dinosaurs? </h2>
                <p> For me and many others, dinosaurs were always a spectacle while we were children. The likes of Jurassic Park
                     and documentaries captivated me and to this day I still derive a lot of joy from learning about the topic.
                     So this website will have some information on the reptiles we think of as being surreal, but once lived
                     on the Earth much like other animals do today.
