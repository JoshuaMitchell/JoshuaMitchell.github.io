            <h2> Normalizing Monsters </h2>
                <p> Unfortunately an image of giant lizards, and later, the aggressive titans of Hollywood attacking people, has ingrained the name
                    Dinosaur into the public's brain for what it means literally. I'd personally like for people to see it in a better light,
                    one that is much more realistic to how we view any other animal in today's world. So I'd like to show a handful of renditions
                    on more "realistic" dinosaurs, if that is how you'd like to imagine it.
