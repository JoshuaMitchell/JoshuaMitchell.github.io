                <h2> What are Dinosaurs? </h2>
                <p> Dinosauria, meaning "terrible lizards," is a clade of reptiles that developed in the Triassic period between 240 and 231 million years ago,
                    and still exist today as modern birds. The group as a whole are extremely successful at diversifying themselves
                    and have existed in many niches for millions of years. The disctinction of the group as a whole from other reptiles can be 
                    simplified to:
                </p>
                 <!--A list-->
                    <ol>
                        <li> Legs held erect below the body </li>
                        <li> Higher metabolism that would have necessitated an active lifestyle</li>
                        <li> Hands(or front legs) that face one another in a natural stance</li>
                    </ol>
                
                <p> Though Dinosaurs are not technically extinct, the group you imagine at the mention clearly don't walk on Earth.
                     Around 66 million years ago, the Cretaceous-Paelogene(K-Pg) Extinction occurred and wiped out the entire group outside
                     of avian members of the group. This left birds to take up the roles of their ancestors in the following years until mammals developed.
